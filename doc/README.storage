Handling Of Storage Devices Since 10.0
======================================

Storage Device Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We distinguish between three different types of storage devices:
- static system devices
  This are all built in devices which will never be removed or disconnected
  (disconnected != unmounted; unmounted device may still be connected)
- dynamic system devices
  This are removable or disconnectable devices which serve the whole system and
  not only one single user. For example this may be special data disks or backup
  systems.
- dynamic user devices
  This are removable device which belong to a certain user. For example a
  private usb stick or camera. Or mostly CD and DVD devices.


Static System Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These are configured in /etc/fstab as usual. If kernel modules need to be loaded
to access one of these devices, these should be listed in
    /etc/sysconfig/kernel:INITRD_MODULES
since we do not mount them via hotplug events. Alternatively you can treat it
like a dynamic system device despite it is not really removable.


Dynamic System Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These can be configured as well in /etc/fstab, but you have to add the new mount
option 'hotplug'. If devices with this mount option are not available at boot
time, then this is not an error.
Since hotplugged devices rarely have a persistent device node, you should prefer
the persistent links to them. You get a list of all available links to a storage
device node with the command 'udevinfo -q symlink -n <device node>'.
Example: 
oran:~ # udevinfo -q symlink -n /dev/sda1 
disk/by-id/usb-USB_Flash_Disk_32311AE03FB82538-part1
disk/by-path/usb-32311AE03FB82538:0:0:0-part1 
disk/by-uuid/41AB-430C 
oran:~ # cat /etc/fstab
...
/dev/disk/by-uuid/41AB-430C /music ext3 hotplug,ro,user 0 2
...

When this device is plugged the filesystem will be checked and if no error
occurs then mounted. If an error occurs you won't get a message in normal
operation mode. Only if /etc/udev/udev.conf:udev_log=info is set, udev will pass
error messages to syslog.
Further you should not use the mount option 'noauto', because all storage
devices which are not already mounted via udev will be considered as dynamic
user device from hal/subfs.


Dynamic User Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All storage devices which are not already mounted via udev will be considered as
dynamic user device from hal/subfs. This means they will be handled via subfs.
To change the behavior of hal/subfs you have to modify/create fdi files in
/usr/share/hal/fdi. See documentation of hal and subfs for details.


Configuration means
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Currently there are two variables in /etc/sysconfig/storage, but these will be
very probably removed in further releases:
HOTPLUG_MOUNT_FSTAB=yes/no indicates if storage devices should be mounted via
hotplug events at all. But you can also just add/remove fstab lines instead.
HOTPLUG_CHECK_FILESYSTEMS=yes/no is a global switch if filesystems on dynamic
system devices should be checked. Also this may be configured in /etc/fstab.


Outlook
^^^^^^^
In next release we will mount all storage devices except boot device via hotplug
events. The boot script that did this job up to now will then just monitor this
and check if all mandatory devices are there at a given time. Nevertheless the
configuration in fstab will stay the same. All devices without 'hotplug' will be
mandatory.
Hopefully we can teach hal/subfs to leave devices alone which are listed in
fstab with mount option 'noauto'.
