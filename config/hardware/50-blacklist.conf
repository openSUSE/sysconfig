# Listing a module here prevents modprobe from loading it via modalias (only
# aliases from /lib/modules/*/modules.alias). You may still load it explicitly.
# We blacklist some modules because they may harm on certain devices or they
# prevent other modules from grabbing the device.
#
# Syntax:  blacklist <driver name>
# See 'man modprobe'.

# usbcore ... module is loaded implicitly, ignore it otherwise

# Blacklist acpi_power_meter. The device requires processing ACPI AML code to
# update average power measurement. This may be at a high frequency and has

# very few applications require the data, blacklist the module by default
