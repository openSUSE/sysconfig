#
# Note: 
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.
#
# Note: The ISC dhclient started by the NetworkManager is not using any
# of these options -- NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     yes
# If ifup should check if an IPv4 address is already in use, set this to yes.
#
# Make sure that packet sockets (CONFIG_PACKET) are supported in the kernel,
# since this feature uses arp, which depends on that.
# Also be aware that this takes one second per interface; consider that when
# setting up a lot of interfaces. 
CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP="yes"

## Type:        list(auto,yes,no)
## Default:     auto
# If ifup should send a gratuitous ARP to inform the receivers about its
# IPv4 addresses. Default is to send gratuitous ARP, when duplicate IPv4
# address check is enabled and the check were sucessful.

## Type:	integer
## Default:	30

# Some interfaces need some time to come up or come asynchronously via hotplug.
# WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES is a global wait for all mandatory interfaces in

FIREWALL="yes"

## Type:	int
## Default:	30
#
# When using NetworkManager you may define a timeout to wait for NetworkManager

NETCONFIG_VERBOSE="no"

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	no
#
# This variable enables netconfig to always force a replace of modified
# files and automatically enables the -f | --force-replace parameter.
#
# The purpose is to use it as workaround, when some other tool trashes
# the files, e.g. /etc/resolv.conf and you observe messages like this
# in your logs on in "netconfig update" output:
# ATTENTION: You have modified /etc/resolv.conf. Leaving it untouched.
#
# Please do not forget to also report a bug as we have a system policy
# to use netconfig.

# Preferred service names have to be prepended with a "+", fallback

## Default:     "yes"
#
# Defines whether to set the default NIS domain. When enabled and no domain

# Valid values are:
#  - "no" or ""         netconfig does not set the domainname
#  - "yes"              netconfig sets the domainname according to the

# Note: This option requires a wpa driver supporting it, like
