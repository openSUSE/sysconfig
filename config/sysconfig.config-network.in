## Path:	Network/General
## Description:	Global network configuration
#
# Note: 
# Most of the options can and should be overridden by per-interface
# settings in the ifcfg-* files.
#
# Note: The ISC dhclient started by the NetworkManager is not using any
# of these options -- NetworkManager is not using any sysconfig settings.
#

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     yes
# If ifup should check if an IPv4 address is already in use, set this to yes.
#
# Make sure that packet sockets (CONFIG_PACKET) are supported in the kernel,
# since this feature uses arp, which depends on that.
# Also be aware that this takes one second per interface; consider that when
# setting up a lot of interfaces. 
CHECK_DUPLICATE_IP="yes"

## Type:        list(auto,yes,no)
## Default:     auto
# If ifup should send a gratuitous ARP to inform the receivers about its
# IPv4 addresses. Default is to send gratuitous ARP, when duplicate IPv4
# address check is enabled and the check were sucessful.
#
# Make sure that packet sockets (CONFIG_PACKET) are supported in the kernel,
# since this feature uses arp, which depends on that.
SEND_GRATUITOUS_ARP="auto"

## Type:        yesno
## Default:     no
# Switch on/off debug messages for all network configuration stuff. If set to no
# most scripts can enable it locally with "-o debug".
DEBUG="no"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	30
#
# Some interfaces need some time to come up or come asynchronously via hotplug.
# WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES is a global wait for all mandatory interfaces in
# seconds. If empty no wait occurs.
#
WAIT_FOR_INTERFACES="30"

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	yes
#
# With this variable you can determine if the SuSEfirewall when enabled
# should get started when network interfaces are started.
FIREWALL="yes"

## Type:	int
## Default:	30
#
# When using NetworkManager you may define a timeout to wait for NetworkManager
# to connect in NetworkManager-wait-online.service.  Other network services
# may require the system to have a valid network setup in order to succeed.
#
# This variable has no effect if NetworkManager is disabled.
#
NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT="30"

## Type:	string
## Default:	''
#
# Set this variable global variable to the ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2
# country code specifying the wireless regulatory domain to set.
# When not empty, ifup-wireless will be set in the wpa_supplicant
# config or via 'iw reg set' command.
#
# Note: This option requires a wpa driver supporting it, like
# the 'nl80211' driver used by default since openSUSE 11.3.
# When you notice problems with your hardware, please file a
# bug report and set e.g. WIRELESS_WPA_DRIVER='wext' (the old
# default driver) in the ifcfg file.
# See also "/usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant --help" for the list of
# available wpa drivers.

WIRELESS_REGULATORY_DOMAIN=''
